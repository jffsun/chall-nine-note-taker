# Challenge Nine: Express.js - Note Taker

## Project Description

Challenge Nine required us to modify the starter code so that the Note Taker application can write and save a user's notes. The application uses the Express framework to handle different HTTP methods in an API route, allowing the user to send GET, POST, and DELETE requests to the server with a response returned to them. We then utilized Heroku to deploy the application.
